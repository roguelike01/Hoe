This was a project done with the AP Literature and Composition classes. They had been reading and listening to Frankenstein, and I believed a critical thinking project was needed to get them to understand to dynamic between Victor Frankenstein and his creature. My mentor teacher and I formulated a way to recreate what Victor had gone through and have the students encounter a similar scenario. It was a way to showcase the fundamental aspects Shelly was critiquing about Victor. 

We started the project by providing materials for the students and allowing the to form family units. With these units in place the students had to create a monster, take a selfie with it, write it's personal information, and write a letter addressing how they felt about this creature. This letter would give them an understanding of how they wanted to interact with this creation of theirs. Would they form an attachment to it? Hate and distaste it? or would it simply be forgotten when the project was over? While the students were thinking over their feeling about their creatures, I was walking around the classroom comparing and contrasting them to victor. This was meant to impart what Shelly was trying to critique about Victor and what is good or evil about over-reach. I also tried to instill with each conversation or discussion that Shelly's message is that "monsters" are not born monsters but are instead created by the mistreatment they may suffer. At least in regards to the creature in the book.
